# DataAnalysis_TermFinalProject
CTIS365 - Data Analysis Final Term Project. (R Language, ggplot2 Library) 02/01/2021

## Satisfied Project Requirements and Phases
Phase I (Due date November 1, 2020)
1. Select and state the topic of your term project. You can use the course Moodle page to explore
some of the project topics by inspecting the Project Ideas section. Your project area does not need
to be restricted to the suggested topics. You can use a completely new subject of your choice.
2. Find between 8-10 different scientific journal papers and/or URLs that are related to your project
topic and write a 4-6 pages summary explaining your topic and the important parameters that are
required to conduct the study. The type of dataset (data related to your country is preferred, if
you will use any other data you need to provide a justification for it) and its source that you will
use to conduct your project, the work that has been done related to your selected topic (use the
scientific journal papers and/or URLs for this purpose) and what do you plan to do in this project.
Please keep in mind that you can produce results similar to the already existing ones but you need
to provide some new contributions (for example you might use different and enhanced graphics
or tables etc.).
3. To search scientific journal papers related to your topics you can use the following databases
- Web of Knowledge
- Science Direct
- Scopus
- IEEE
- ACM
4. All resources cannot be of the same type i.e., all 8-10 different items cannot be just papers or URLs.
5. Provide a reference for the used resources (papers and URLs) in your summary. Use the below
given link for citation formatting guidelines.
CTIS 365 â€“ Homeworks + Term Project 2
6. Each team or an individual must meet the instructor to discuss the proposed project and get
feedback on their first report within 10 days of the submission deadline. The homework grade will
be announced to the students at the end of the meeting.
Phase II (Due date December 6, 2020)
1. You need to collect, clean and prepare the data to be used in your project.
2. You need to mention the source(s) of your data and should only use R and RStudio for the data
preparation phase.
3. Provide descriptive statistics of your data (see the uploaded paper for reference).
4. Provide a citation for the data by using the guidelines provided in the below given link.
5. Produce frequency distribution tables and/or graphs again by using only R and RStudio to present
results of your dataset. Remember the graph plotting is more of an exploratory phase rather than
the explanatory phase, hence, the produced plots do not need to be professional looking at this
stage. You will refine them in the final phase of the project.
6. Each team or an individual must meet the instructor to discuss this phase of the project and get
feedback on their second report within 10 days of the submission deadline. The homework grade
will be announced to the students at the end of the meeting.
Phase III (Due date December 22, 2020)
1. Write a term project report in a paper format (see the below given link) or create a Blog containing
the refined contents from Phase I and Phase II together will additional results and explanation. Keep
in mind that you should use good data visualization and presentation skills here as they are the key
for a good Blog or paper. While grading this phase, quality of work, presentation style, used
visualization methods and formatting will be considered important.
2. Things to be uploaded to the course Moodle page inside a zip folder
a. The LaTeX and pdf file or word file.
b. R-script(s) used to generate graphs, tables or maps.
c. Data file.
